##Peer to Peer - PA4

This program implements a P2P client and server, over TCP Sockets.
The server maintains a list of all available files at each client, 
and points clients towards the client that has the file requested.

To start the server:
./server_PFS <Port>

The client connects to the server and sends messages indicating
what file it wants transfered, or to list all available files. The
client also handles get requests from other clients, and transfers 
files via a direct TCP connection.

To start the client:
./client_PFS <Client Name> <Server IP> <Server Port>
